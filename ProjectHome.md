# ruTorrent Label Management Suite #

Welcome to the ultimate organizational suite for ruTorrent! The goal of this project is to change the default manner in which ruTorrent uses labels to add flexibility and usability. This project currently consists of two plugins:

## tadd-labels ##

This plugin creates a drop-down menu in the add-torrent dialog page that automatically loads all currently used labels. This replaces the previous textbox where one would enter a label by hand. It also adds a textbox for new labels.

## sort-labels ##

This plugin takes the current labels column along the left side and allows the nesting of labels. It automagically sorts your torrent labels based on sub-categories signified by the "/" symbol. See the screenshot for an example.

## implementation ##

Implementing the new label system is easy thanks to the extensibility of ruTorrent. Simply unpack lbll-suite`_``*`.tar.bz into your rutorrent/plugins directory, and ruTorrent does the rest!
